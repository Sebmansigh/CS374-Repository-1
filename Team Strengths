Sebastian Snyder:
Top three strengths:
		I am really good at breaking problems down
		I perform well under pressure
		(Strength ?) I am really good at "games of definitions" (I am very pedantic.)
		
		
How do I perform:
		I like to have checklists
		I don't like to use more resources than I have to.
		I continue to think about better solutions after I complete a problem.

		
What are my values:
		I am honest
		I don't beat around the bush; I'll tell you how it is
		I strive to improve myself
		Purple
		

What can be expected of my contributions:
		I will over-document everything I write; you will be able to run the javadoc tool on my code
		I will make an effort to keep everything abstract; I will not use strings and ints to represent something else, I'll make a class for it.
		I will write efficient code whereever possible.
